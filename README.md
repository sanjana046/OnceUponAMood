# OnceUponAMood

Inspiration Journaling is a powerful way to process thoughts and emotions, but sometimes it’s hard to know what to do with those feelings once they’re written down. We wanted to create a journal that not only lets you write but understands you, offering thoughtful guidance to help users navigate their moods. That’s how OnceUponAMood was born a journal that goes beyond writing to become a supportive companion.

What it does OnceUponAMood allows users to write journal entries freely. Using AI-powered sentiment analysis, the app detects the user’s mood and offers personalized suggestions, such as:

Advice: Thoughtful guidance tailored to your emotional state.
Movie Recommendations: Movies to complement your mood.
Song Suggestions: A curated list of songs tailored to your mood. Whether you’re feeling joyful, stressed, or reflective, OnceUponAMood offers meaningful ways to engage with your emotions.
